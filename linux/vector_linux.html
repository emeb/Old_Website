<h1> <b>My experience with Vector Linux</b></h1>
 In March 2006 I decided that RH9 was too much for my old Micron laptop.
 I searched through Distrowatch for a lightweight Linux distro that would
 provide a minimal window manager like Fluxbox or ICEwm, yet support a
 newer 2.6 kernel.</p>
 
 Vector Linux looked like good option - it met all the criteria and had a
 simple installer. I tried out the Live CD version of 5.1 and was suitably
 impressed.</p>
 
 I installed it. Twice. I fiddled with the Slackware-style init scripts to get
 it to recognize my ancient Prism2-based WLAN card and my ESS Maestro2e audio
 device. Eventually (after tweaking the scripts) it worked. Then I tried
 using their APT-based upgrading system and it lost all my previous tweaks. </p>
 
 I canned it </p>
