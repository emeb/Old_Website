# 802.11b Networking


802.11b Wireless networking ("Wi-Fi") is a great solution for medium
speed connectivity in mobile and home situations.
I use [Addtron](http://www.addtron.com), [Belkin](http://www.belkin.com) and [Linksys](http://www.linksys.com) components based
on the Prism 2/2.5/3 chipsets from [Intersil](http://www.intersil.com):
  

- Addtron AWS-100 Access Point

- Linksys WAP11 Access Point

- Addtron AWP-100 PCMCIA Card

- Belkin F5D6001 PCI Card

I've found these components to be inexpensive and reliable in my
usage, which consists mainly of laptops running Linux and Win9x in a home
environment.

### Linux


There are several linux drivers which work with Prism based products:
  

- [linux-wlan-ng](http://www.linux-wlan.org/index.html)

- wvlan-cs (part of the linux
[pcmcia-cs](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcmcia-cs/)
drivers)

I've used both of these successfully, but I find the linux-wlan-ng drivers
to have greater functionality and are very actively maintained, although a tad
harder to install.
