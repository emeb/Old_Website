ALS 120 Sound</H2>
My Pentium 166 machine has an Inland ALS120 sound card that I bought at 
Fry's Electronics for less than $10.00.&nbsp;It's not a bad sound card, 
but RedHat's sndconfig utility seems to have trouble configuring it and 
ends up assigning resources for features that don't exist.&nbsp;Fear not 
though, it works well if you convince the system that it's really a 
SoundBlaster Pro.&nbsp;
Here are my <A HREF="./isapnp.conf">/etc/isapnp.conf</A>and 
<A HREF="./conf.modules">/etc/conf.modules</A> files which you can use 
to get this card going on your system.

<P>A lot of folks have been interested in this material after finding
my initial posting on the RedHat sound-list archive.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
even when using the information in my files above some seem to have troubles
getting the ALS120 to work.&nbsp; Others have had no difficuly at all.&nbsp;
Please let me know your experiences so that I can pass it along to others.
