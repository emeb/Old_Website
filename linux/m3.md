## 
ESS Maestro 3 & Allegro


### 
Background


Based on his original [Maestro](m2e.html) driver, Zach Brown has recently
released a [Maestro 3 and Allegro driver](http://www.zabbo.net/maestro3) 
for beta testing. This driver currently supports stereo playback, record and APM suspend/resume. Additional features such as MPU401 MIDI and SPDIF are possible.

Good news! Zach's driver is going into the kernel source. Look for it in 2.2.19 and 2.4.1!
