### What is it?


This is a small board with a TI OMAP-L138 processor, two USB ports, Ethernet,
RS-232, VGA out, Composite in, SD/MMC slot, SATA, audio I/O and an expansion
port. I haven't done much with it besides confirm that it powers up and I can
talk to it via UART and Ethernet. Find out more about it at the following sites:
