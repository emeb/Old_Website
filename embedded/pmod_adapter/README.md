#### PMOD Adapter Board


## What is it?


This is a simple adapter board that converts the
[BCC](../bcc/index.html) 28-pin connector to 3 12-pin PMOD connectors.
Using this board it is possible to connect several PMODs to the BCC for I/O
expansion. Since the BCC provides only 3.3V power on its connector, the adapter
also has a terminal pin for an alternate power supply and jumpers to select
either 3.3V or the alternate supply for each PMOD connector.
