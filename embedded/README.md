# Embedded


A lot of the stuff that I do seems to revolve around small computers doing
small jobs. This is the essence of embedded computing. Many of these small
jobs are specifically related to electronic music synthesis, so you'll find
more about them over on my [Synth page](../synth).
Projects of a more general interest are here though.
