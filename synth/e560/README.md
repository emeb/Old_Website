## Introduction


The E560 Deflector Shield is a Euro-rack digital audio effects module that
implements a conventional Bode Frequency shift function as well as standard
ring mod and a phase-shift. A unique feature of the E560 is morphing control
over the carrier waveform, allowing more than just the standard sinusoidal
shapes that provide pure shifts. This provides some interesting harmonic
structures and modulations.

In addition, the E560 also provides Wet/Dry mixing of the input and
processed signals, variable positive and inverted feedback and outputs both
up- and down-shifted frequency components simultaneously.
