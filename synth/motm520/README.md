MOTM 520 / MOTM 521



# MOTM 520 / MOTM 521


## Introduction


The MOTM 520 Cloud Generator is a multi-oscillator module originally architected as a PIC controlling
a bank of hardware NCOs. I was brough on board in mid 2006 to revise the design with an
ARM MCU and FPGA. Since then a prototype based on the Xilinx Spartan 3E Starter Kit from
Digilent, coupled with a Analog Devices ADuC7026 and an audio-quality stereo DAC has
been built and demonstrated at several synth gatherings. 


Because the hardware has much more capability than is easily accessed through the '520
user interface, a second module, the MOTM 521 Cloud Expander is under consideration which would provide control of the
50+ parameters, as well as patch storage and additional waveform outputs.
 
## Preliminary Specifications

* Spread control (oscillator detune)
* Wide/Narrow Spread range
* Chaos control (random FM on each oscillator)
* Phase control


### MOTM 521


* 4x20 LCD
* 6 encoders
* USB port for patch management via PC
