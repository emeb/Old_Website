# Radio


My "day jobs" typically end up somehow related to RF and Communications. I've
been working in this area professionally for more than 25 years now, but I
also enjoy doing it recreationally as well. A few of the things I've done in
my spare time recently are here:

* [Digilent HF-band TX DAC Pmod](txdac)
* [Gnu Radio](gnuradio)
* [RTL-SDR - Cheap SDR hardware](rtl-sdr)
* [RTL-SDR on a Beaglebone](bone-rtl)
* [Digilent RX ADC Pmod](rxadc)
* [HF Receiver prototype](hfrx)
* [ADS-B Cape](adsb-cape)
* [HF SDR prototype](hfsdr_proto)
* [iceRadio](iceRadio)
* [5th-order LC filter](filter5)
* [HF Bone SDR system](hfbone)
* [R820T2 Tuner Breakout](r820t2_breakout)
* [14-bit RXADC Pmod](rxadc14)
* More to come
