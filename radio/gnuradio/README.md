GNU Radio




# What is it?


[GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki)
is an ambitious project to build up a completely
Open-Source environment for development of Software-Defined Radio systems.
It consists of a large library of tightly-coded DSP functions written mostly
in C++ and tied together with a Python-based build system. There are resources
for adding useful GUI elements in a variety of windowing systems, as well as
interfaces to hardware I/O to allow realtime processing of RF and audio
data.

### Projects


I've been playing around with a few simple projects that may be helpful.

* [Simple broadcast FM receiver (mono-only)](wbfm_mono.grc)
* More to come
